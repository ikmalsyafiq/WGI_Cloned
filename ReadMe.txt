Project Objective:
This project is designed to remodel/refine the mathematical formula of grading water
for each of the "River" Water Source. This formula is then serve as a proper metrics
to evaluate the quality of the water (Stand at water operator perspective) and ultimately
serve as a negotiation tools for raw water price with the governemnt.

The project is written using python and using pandas, sklearn & numpy (not limited) because
the processing of the data can still be handle by local machine.


File Descriptions:

C_Data Foler: Clean Data for modelling
CC: Clean Chemical Daily Dosing Data
Data_Extraction_Latets: Latest WQ Parameters Data provided by Production Team (2020 & 2022)
WQ: Clean WQ Daily Parameters Data

Note Book:
Data_Cleansing_******: These are the file being used to clean the data (Eg: Regroup of chemical and etc)
WGI_Model-General: This is the file being used to train model and generate WGI Score

Excel File:
These excel files will be leverage at the stage of data cleaning & WGI evaluation purpose.
